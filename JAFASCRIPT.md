Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of ema i 1 .
 ## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER :

 #### Modify t he content of the page
 #### Program rules or instructions t he browser can follow
 #### React to events triggered by t he user or browser 
 ## What a Script?
 ### A script is  a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
 ## Writing a script
 ### To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

 ## SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART:
 ### Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step.
