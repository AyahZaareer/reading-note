# Traditional HTML Layouts
## For a long time, web page authors used '(div) elements to grouptogether related elements on the page (such as the elements that form header, an article, footer orsidebar).Authors used class or id attributesto indicate the role of the (div) element in the structure of the page.

# New Html5 Layout Elements
## HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up theparts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of contentyou will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has notstopped many web page authors using them already.

# Sectioning Elements(div)
## It may seem strange to followthese new elements by revisitingthe (div) element again. (Afterall, the new elements are oftengoing to be used in its place.

# DOCTYPEs
## Because there have been several versions of HTML, eachweb page should begin with aDOCTYPE declaration to tell abrowser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display thepage even if it is not included).
# Comments in HTML
# (!-- --)
## If you want to add a commentto your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
## (!-- comment goes here --)

# ID Attribute
## Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

# Class Attribute
## Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

# Block Elements
## Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. Examples of block elements are (h1), (p), (ul), and (li)

## Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements. Examples of inline elements are (a), (b), (em), and (img).
