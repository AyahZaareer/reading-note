# What is Markdown?
## Markdown is a way to style text on the web. We control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## We can use Markdouwn syntax in GitHub to style web site ,for example:
**We use # in begging of line to write a header**

# The first header

## The second header

### The third header
