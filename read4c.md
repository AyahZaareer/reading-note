# How do I write a script for a web page?
## JavaScript is w ritten in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new t ools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 



## When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML < script > element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

## You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening < script> and closing < /script> tags (but it is better to put script s in their own files).


## A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
